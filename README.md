# NZP: Eight Players Server Binary
A very messy chunk of files which serve as the dedicated server for NZP: Eight Players. I am not going to try and add any instructions on how to use this, however I will probably help you if you ask.

As a note, this server is hosted (and tested) on Linux only. If you're hosting this on Windows, please don't.
